IOStreams
=======
FileInputStream, FileOutputStream
BufferedInputStream, BufferedOutputStream
FileReader, FileWriter
BufferedReader, BufferedWriter
Serialization (ObjectOutputStream, ObjectInputStream)
--------------------******************-------------------------------
InputStream and OutputStream read and writes stream of bytes (ASCII range chars, each char occupies 1 byte memory). ASCII 0-255

Reader and Writer read and writes stream of chars (Unicode range chars, each char occupies 2 bytes of memory). Unicode 0-65535

InputStream and its sub class FileInputStream contains one important method called 
  public int read()
  reads each character and returns its ASCII value

OutputStream and its sub class FileOutputStream contains one important method called 
  public void write(int i)
  takes char ASCII values, but writes original char into output stream
--------------------******************-------------------------------
Text files can be read and write using DataInputStream and DataOutputStream.
While creating DataInputStream give FileInputStream object as argument, so that it will read line-line data from a file.
DataInputStream:
  read line-line of data
  String readLine()
  
While creating DataOutputStream give FileOutputStream object as argument, so that it will write line-line of data into a file.  
DataOutputStream:
  writes line-line of data
  void writeBytes(String str)
  void writeChars(String str)
--------------------******************-------------------------------
Text / Binary files can be read and write using BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream.
While creating BufferedInputStream give FileInputStream object and buffer size  as arguments, so that it will read buffer-buffer data from a file.
DataInputStream:
  read buffer-buffer of data
  int read(byte[], int start, int len)
  
While creating BufferedOutputStream give FileOutputStream object and buffer size as argument, so that it will write buffer-buffer of data into a file.  
DataOutputStream:
  writes buffer-buffer of data
  void write(byte b][, int start, int len)
